#   Here we define who the agent will send traps to.

# trap2sink: A SNMPv2c trap receiver
#   arguments: host [community] [portnum]

trap2sink  "labcom.inf.ufrgs.br public " public 

# informsink: A SNMPv2c inform (acknowledged trap) receiver
#   arguments: host [community] [portnum]

informsink  labcom.inf.ufrgs.br public 

# trapcommunity: Default trap sink community to use
#   arguments: community-string

#   This section defines who is allowed to talk to your running
#   snmp agent.

# rwuser: a SNMPv3 read-write user
#   arguments:  user [noauth|auth|priv] [restriction_oid]

rwuser  kitsune noauth 
rwuser  root auth 

# rwcommunity: a SNMPv1/SNMPv2c read-write access community name
#   arguments:  community [default|hostname|network/bits] [oid]

# SECTION: Monitor Various Aspects of the Running Host
#
#   The following check up on various aspects of a host.

# proc: Check for processes that should be running.
#     proc NAME [MAX=0] [MIN=0]
#   
#     NAME:  the name of the process to check for.  It must match
#            exactly (ie, http will not find httpd processes).
#     MAX:   the maximum number allowed to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#     MIN:   the minimum number to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#   
#   The results are reported in the prTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree
#   Special Case:  When the min and max numbers are both 0, it assumes
#   you want a max of infinity and a min of 1.

proc    

# disk: Check for disk space usage of a partition.
#   The agent can check the amount of available disk space, and make
#   sure it is above a set limit.  
#   
#    disk PATH [MIN=100000]
#   
#    PATH:  mount path to the disk in question.
#    MIN:   Disks with space below this value will have the Mib's errorFlag set.
#           Can be a raw integer value (units of kB) or a percentage followed by the %
#           symbol.  Default value = 100000.
#   
#   The results are reported in the dskTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree

disk   

# load: Check for unreasonable load average values.
#   Watch the load average levels on the machine.
#   
#    load [1MAX=12.0] [5MAX=12.0] [15MAX=12.0]
#   
#    1MAX:   If the 1 minute load average is above this limit at query
#            time, the errorFlag will be set.
#    5MAX:   Similar, but for 5 min average.
#    15MAX:  Similar, but for 15 min average.
#   
#   The results are reported in the laTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree

# SECTION: System Information Setup
#
#   This section defines some of the information reported in
#   the "system" mib group in the mibII tree.

# syslocation: The [typically physical] location of the system.
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysLocation.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  location_string

syslocation  "Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Institute of Informatics, block 4, building 43424, room 106"

# syscontact: The contact information for the administrator
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysContact.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  contact_string
